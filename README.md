# Lab-Scoring-Management-Platform

This project is intended to be a lab scoring and management platform that allows for the teacher to easily manage and score lab submissions from students. This platform provides for the teacher to easily track all students' lab submission. It also allows for the scoring of labs based upon the lab providing the correct input/output, similar to a fuzzer.

This project was created by Akul Arora, Manseej Khatri, Maximus Novak, and Darshan Parekh as part of Mr. Lantsberger's AP Computer Science end of the year project.

## Setup

To run the web server Apache Tomcat is required:
http://tomcat.apache.org/

For reference, this project was largely created using Eclipse Java EE Oxygen with Java 10.
More information on Eclipse can be found here: https://www.eclipse.org/

If you use Eclipse, you will need to configure Eclipse to work with the Tomcat installation in order for code to be deployed to the server.
